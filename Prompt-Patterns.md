## WHat is a prompt

A prompt is a text-based input that is used to guide a large language model (LLM) towards generating a specific response. It serves as a starting point or instruction for the LLM to process information and produce relevant output. It can also be a means to provide additional information to the LLM. 

### Intuition behind prompts

Large language models are designed to predict the next word based on patterns in the text they've been trained on, often from vast amounts of internet data. This continuous learning enables them to recognize patterns and make accurate predictions about what should come next. Understanding how large language models detect patterns and applying that intuition to craft prompts helps guide the model toward desired outcomes. This is where prompt patterns come into playâ€”they offer a structured way to frame prompts to achieve more consistent and effective results when interacting with the model.

## Prompt Patterns


In the world of large language models, patterns in prompts play a crucial role in shaping the model's behavior. These models are trained on vast amounts of data and have become proficient at recognizing and responding to patterns in language. A prompt pattern is essentially a structured way of phrasing words and statements to consistently achieve a desired outcome when interacting with a model. By following specific patterns, users can guide the model's responses to solve particular problems. For instance, using a familiar phrase like "Mary had a little" can consistently trigger the generation of "lamb, its fleece was as white as snow." While there may be slight variations, this approach gives users more control over the output, making prompt patterns a powerful tool in prompt engineering.


## Persona Pattern

The persona pattern is one of the most powerful tools in prompt engineering, allowing users to tap into the specialized behavior of a large language model. This pattern is particularly useful when you're unsure of the exact format or details of the output you need but know who you would ask for help in the real world. For instance, if you had a question about finances, you would consult an accountant. Similarly, you can guide the model by assigning it a specific persona to provide relevant responses.

Prompt Example:
"You are an experienced accountant. I need advice on how to optimize my tax deductions for the year. What should I consider?"

By assigning the model a persona, you can shape its responses to reflect the expertise of that role, making the output more tailored and accurate to the context.
